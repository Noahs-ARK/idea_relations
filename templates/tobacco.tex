The issue of smoking came to the forefront in the 1990s, when a series of studies revealed that the use of tobacco products were a significant risk for for cancer and other diseases, particularly lung cancer. This led to an historic settlement in which the major tobacco manufacturers agreed to pay a large settlement, as well as agreeing to restriction on adverting and so forth... [I really don't know much about this issue].

These events are revealed in the contrast between discussion of a cancer  topic  and a settlement topic, which are in a head-to-head relation to each other. Each of these in turn is linked to related parts of the discussion, with cancer in a friends relation with ``study, research, found, ...'' and ``smoke, secondhand smoke, health''. By contrast, the actual settlement seems to have been discussed mostly with respect to the business, financial, and legal ramifications, and the settlement topic can be found in a friends relation with ``tobacco, company, case, ...'' and ``court, case, judge, ...''.
